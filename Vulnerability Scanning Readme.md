# Comprehensive Web Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

This project is a powerful, customizable web vulnerability scanner that combines the capabilities of OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) with custom Python scripting. It's designed to identify a wide range of security vulnerabilities in web applications, including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and many more.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: This tool is for educational and authorized testing purposes only. Always obtain explicit permission before scanning any systems you do not own.** ⚠️

## Features

- Integration with OWASP ZAP for robust scanning capabilities
- Custom vulnerability checks using asyncio for efficient, concurrent scanning
- Subdomain discovery
- Comprehensive vulnerability reporting
- Customizable configuration
- Support for resuming interrupted scans

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OWASP ZAP
- Various Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-vulnerability-scanner.git
   cd web-vulnerability-scanner
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install and set up OWASP ZAP. Make note of your API key.

5. Create a `config.yaml` file in the project root directory:
   ```yaml
   zap_url: 'http://localhost:8080'
   user_agent: 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3'
   rate_limit_max: 10
   rate_limit_time: 1
   ```

## Usage

Basic usage:
```
python vulnerability_scanner.py example.com --apikey YOUR_ZAP_API_KEY --output results.json
```

Advanced usage:
```
python vulnerability_scanner.py example.com --apikey YOUR_ZAP_API_KEY --output results.json --timeout 600 --debug --proxy http://localhost:8080
```

## Configuration

You can customize the scanner's behavior by modifying the `config.yaml` file. Available options include:

- `zap_url`: URL where OWASP ZAP is running
- `user_agent`: User agent string to use for requests
- `rate_limit_max`: Maximum number of requests per time unit
- `rate_limit_time`: Time unit for rate limiting (in seconds)

## Adding Custom Checks

To add a new vulnerability check:

1. Create a new method in the `VulnerabilityScanner` class:
   ```python
   async def check_new_vulnerability(self, session: aiohttp.ClientSession, url: str) -> bool:
       # Implement your check here
       pass
   ```

2. Add the new check to the `run_scans` method:
   ```python
   self.check_vulnerability(session, self.check_new_vulnerability, "New Vulnerability")
   ```
